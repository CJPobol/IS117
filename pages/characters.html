            <h2>The Main Character</h2>
            <p>When first beginning the game, the player gets the option of playing as Ashley or Ashton, a set of twins that serve as a method for the player to choose their preferred gender to play as. Despite going through the same journey depending on this choice, Ashley and Ashton have minor personality differences that make them unique. While Ashton is more bitter against the world that exiled him and confused about Earth customs at times, Ashley is a bit more optimistic and curious to learn more about the world. Both are suited with an orange radiant, making them members of the Legion. However, their lack of willingness to pursue that career path led to trouble with the government, and their eventual exile. As part of their punishment, Their chip was partially extracted to render them less powerful in the future. This left the main character with only the Link components of their radiant, making them somewhat of a weaker-than-average Link.</p>
            <h2>Charlie</h2>
            <p>One of the first humans from Earth the main character meets, Charlie is a 24 year old man who lives in a secluded, small house with his younger sibling, Jacke. Charlie quickly befriends the main character after helping them adjust to their new life. Being an average Earthling, he relies on Earth's weaponry in combat to defend himself in the early stages of the game. More specifically, a pair of boxing gloves he had found laying around the house. Later on, however, Charlie accidentally acquires the missing components of the main character's chip and his body accepts it as his own, making him a weaker-than-average Spark. This gave Charlie and the main character great synergy in battle, learning to deeply understand each other and swiftly fight as one.</p>
            <h2>Jacke</h2>
            <p>The younger sibling of Charlie, Jacke is a 20 year old who has a much more chaotic, rambunctious personality. Jacke is more than happy to show the main character the ins and outs of being an Earthling, the good and the bad. Much like their brother, Jacke equips somewhat unorthodox weaponry to defend themself in battle due to not possessing a radiant. Their weapon of choice is a wooden baseball bat from their childhood. Although they may not have a particular gift, Jacke's aggressive and confident nature makes them a force to be reckoned with in combat.</p>
            <h2>Natalie</h2>
            <p>Natalie is a proud citizen of The Haevan. Her radiant is blue, and she takes pride in her place in society as a defender of the way their society is <em>supposed</em> to be. The main character encounters her early in the story, when they are first exiled. Natalie is tasked with extracting part of the main character's chip. The main character's fear of being exiled tugs at her heartstrings, though she refuses to admit it. Outwardly, she has no sympathy for anyone that goes against the wishes of society. However, after failing a mission given to her, she is sentenced to exile as well. Although she keeps to herself on Earth, the main character soon finds her and helps her adjust to life on Earth as well. Eventually, she becomes closely acquainted to not only the main character, but Charlie and Jacke as well, joining their team to fight back against the strange creatures appearing on Earth following the main character's arrival on Earth.</p>
